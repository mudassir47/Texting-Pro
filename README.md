# Texting Pro — My First Chat App

Welcome to Texting Pro — my first chat app, a real-time messaging application built with Firebase Firestore and Firebase Facebook authentication. I created this app when I was 1 years old as a way to learn and grow as a developer. I wanted to build something that people could actually use and interact with, and I hope that this chat app can serve as a source of inspiration for other young developers who are just starting out.
